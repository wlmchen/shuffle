# Shuffle

[shuffle.duckdns.org](shuffle.duckdns.org)

A shuffleboard-inspired API-based game. Knock your opponents into the moving lava wall, and capture the toads to gain points.
        
**What's the catch?** Your ability to view the board is rate-limited randomly between 3 and 5 seconds. Attempting to view the board before the rate-limit expires resets it!
